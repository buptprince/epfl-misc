    "(1) Download the Reuters corpus here: http://www.daviddlewis.com/resources/testcollections/reuters21578/\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) **Build a table of quotes alongside the name of the person who uttered it**; i.e., one record of the table could look like this:\n",
    "They brought us whole binders full of women&lt;TAB&gt;Mitt Romney\n",
    "\n",
    "For extracting quotes, it's quite easy to handcraft some high-precision extractor patterns, e.g., in the form of regexes such as \"(.\\*)\", said (.\\*)\n",
    "But if you do only this, then you'll miss out on a lot of quotes that are framed slightly differently (e.g., '\"Bla bla bla?\", the governor asked').\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you think of ways to automatically or semi-automatically expand the set of extractor patterns? You could think of ways of leveraging the fact that some people (such as Ronald Reagan -- the corpus is from the late '80s...) have probably contributed many quotes to the corpus. So-called bootstrapping approaches (such as this one http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/421/1/1999-65.pdf) could work in such a setting.\n",

    "         - turns out this file only consists of people who were the primary focus of an article, so we can use it to look for example quotation-person tuples (get some bootstrap samples) but it's not an exhaustive list of all the people who occur in the corpus.\n",

    "Brin approach for (Title, Author) extraction:\n",
    "- Start by manually adding 5 example (Book, Author) pairs.\n",
    "- Find all documents containing these pairs in a small region of text.\n",
    "    - occurence: (author, title, order, url, prefix, middle, suffix)\n",
    "- From these documents, extract patterns e.g. the document contained &lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;title&lt;/B&gt; by author\n",
    "- Search for these patterns on the Web to find more books\n",
    "\n",
    "**A similar approach for (Quote, Sayer) extraction:**\n",
    "- Start with a few (Quote, Famous_Person) pairs\n",
    "    - So we start with pairs [(\"Mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall\", Ronald Reagan), (\"God bless America\", Ronald Reagan), (\"It's clearly a budget. It's got a lot of numbers in it.\", George Bush) ...]\n",
    "- Find all documents containing these pairs\n",
    "    - could adapt Brin's occurence definition - but do we need to find a 'say' verb in the middle/suffix? I'm not sure that we can just use the exact text we find.\n",
    "        - For example I found \"Reagan to Gorbachev: 'Tear down this wall'!\" which is a quotation pattern I hadn't thought of. \n",
    "        - Another one: \"On June 12, 1987, President Ronald Reagan declared, 'Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.'\"\n",
    "- Extract patterns from these documents\n",
    "- Search for these patterns to find more quote-sayer pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "**One problem** is this Reuters corpus consists primarily of __mundane__ quotes from famous and not-so-famous people. You can find many of Reagan's quotes in the public record but most of the quotes in Reuters are one-offs from a press conference or interview. Thus I don't think there are any quotes that are reused in multiple articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think it's OK to just match any quote and do a fuzzy matching of the quotee. So we would just match (\"anything\", ~Reagan). The problem with this approach is it will match a sentence like \"... the 'geniuses' in the Reagan administration ...\" and then we learn some bad patterns. So it seems we need to use specific quotes and use the grammatical structure to check that Reagan was the person saying the quote.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other datasets/approaches that might be useful**\n",
    "- Cross-reference multiple books or articles that contain the same famous quotations. \n",
    "- Find all the articles written about a specific speech/press-conference (journalists would all hear the same quotes but write their articles differently?)\n",
    "- Use Google search results for each (quote,person) pair basically automating what I did for the \"tear down this wall\" example above\n",
    "- Supervised learning and measure the error rate with crowdsourcing"
